# 🌱 ByteSprout

✨ **ByteSprout** is a little open-source desktop companion inspired by [BYTE90](https://github.com/alxv2016/Byte90-alxvlabs), grown into my own personal project to learn, experiment, and maybe one day evolve into something completely unique.

This repo is a clean fork that I’ll customize over time—adding new faces, behaviors, and hardware support.

## 🚀 What is ByteSprout?

**ByteSprout** is a tiny ESP32-S3-powered bot with:

🌟 A colorful TFT display for animated faces  
🌟 Motion sensing with accelerometer/gyro  
🌟 Custom reactions and idle behaviors  
🌟 Fully hackable firmware (GPL v3)  

---

## 🧠 Why does this exist?

Because I love:
- Tiny robots that feel alive
- Open-source learning
- The idea of growing a project from someone’s seed of inspiration 🌱

This is **not** an official BYTE90 device.  
No proprietary assets (animations, 3D cases, etc) are included.

---

## 🛠️ Features (Work In Progress)

✅ Animated expressions (custom)  
✅ Motion sensing (ADXL345)  
✅ Idle / awake / tilt behaviors  
✅ Open to new sensors (camera, mic, etc)  
✅ Potential for servo movement in future builds

## ✨ My Goals

🌱 Learn embedded firmware development  
🌱 Experiment with displays and sensors  
🌱 Make a robot that feels like a little digital pet  
🌱 Share everything openly so others can build or remix their own bots
